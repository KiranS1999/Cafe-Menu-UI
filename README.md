Creating a cafe order, product and courier menu.

How did you meet the client brief? \
-Maintained a collection of products, orders and couriers data in both CSV files and a database (MySQL) \
-Persisted and loaded data via CSV/database 
-Added feature to update the status of an order (preparing, dispatched, delivered etc.) \
-Added feature to track product inventory in the db \
-UI is clear to navigate and has option to return to main menu 

How did you guarantee the client requirements? \
-Tried to implement unit testing via mock/patch \
-try/except and if/else to catch errors

If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon? \
-Couriers,orders, products into classes using OOP \
-Extensively test my functions

What did you most enjoy implementing? \
-Creating functions and using them to make a program that has multiple features
